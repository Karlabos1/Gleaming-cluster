# Gleaming-cluster
A package of miscellaneous baba is you levels about some game quirks I found.


How to play Gleaming cluster:


The downloaded Gleaming_Cluster folder folder should contain music/palettes/sprites/themes and a bunch of .l, .tmp and .png files named as levels. After certifying that's the case, copy the folder Gleaming_Cluster to your baba is you worlds folder.

For that you need to find where your steam is installed. The baba is you worlds folder is most likely in .../Steamlibrary/steamapps/common/Baba is you/Data/Worlds

After doing so, enable the beta in your baba is your steam application, so that the level editor features can be used, including 
the play levels feature.

In game, under the play level menu, select "play levels" then "play level packages" and select "Gleaming Cluster"
